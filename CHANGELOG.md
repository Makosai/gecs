# GECS Changelog

## [5.1.0] - 2025-01-XX - Relationship System Enhancements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES

#### Relationship Matching Default Changed to Weak Matching
- **`Relationship.matches()` now defaults to weak matching** (`weak = true` instead of `weak = false`)
- **Impact**: Relationship matching now prioritizes component type over exact data matching by default
- **Migration**: Review relationship removal code that relies on exact data matching

**Before (v5.0 and earlier):**
```gdscript
# Strong matching by default - only matched exact component data
relationship.matches(other_relationship)  # weak = false (default)
```

**After (v5.1+):**
```gdscript
# Weak matching by default - matches by component type
relationship.matches(other_relationship)  # weak = true (default)

# For exact data matching, explicitly use strong matching:
relationship.matches(other_relationship, false)
```

### ‚ú® New Features

#### Component Query Support in Relationships
- **Added dictionary-based component queries in relationships** - Filter relationships by component properties
- **Automatic weak/strong matching detection** - Component queries automatically use weak matching
- **New `ComponentQueryMatcher`** - Advanced property-based matching for relationships

#### Limited Relationship Removal
- **Added `limit` parameter to `Entity.remove_relationship()`** - Control exactly how many matching relationships to remove
- **Added `limit` parameter to `Entity.remove_relationships()`** - Apply limits to batch relationship removal operations
- **Backward compatible** - Default behavior unchanged (`limit = -1` removes all matching relationships)

### üö® Migration Guide

#### 1. Review Relationship Matching Code
**Check any manual calls to `relationship.matches()`:**

```gdscript
# ‚ùå This behavior changed (now uses weak matching by default)
if rel.matches(search_relationship):
    # This now matches by component type, not exact data

# ‚úÖ Explicit strong matching (preserves old behavior)
if rel.matches(search_relationship, false):
    # This matches exact component data like before
```

#### 2. Entity Relationship Removal (Usually No Change Needed)
The auto-detection in `Entity.remove_relationship()` maintains expected behavior:

```gdscript
# These work the same as before:
entity.remove_relationship(Relationship.new(C_Damage.new(50), target))  # Strong matching
entity.remove_relationship(Relationship.new({C_Damage: {"value": {"_gt": 20}}}, null))  # Weak matching (auto-detected)
```

#### 3. Test Relationship-Heavy Code
**Areas to test carefully:**
- Custom relationship matching logic
- Systems that rely on exact component data matching
- Relationship queries with specific data requirements

### üéØ New Use Cases Enabled

#### Advanced Component Queries in Relationships
```gdscript
# Remove damage effects above 50 points
entity.remove_relationship(
    Relationship.new({C_Damage: {"amount": {"_gt": 50}}}, null)
)

# Remove buffs with less than 5 seconds remaining
entity.remove_relationship(
    Relationship.new({C_Buff: {"duration": {"_lt": 5.0}}}, null)
)
```

#### Limited Relationship Removal
```gdscript
# Remove 2 poison stacks instead of all
entity.remove_relationship(Relationship.new(C_Poison.new(), null), 2)

# Healing potion removes 3 damage effects
entity.remove_relationship(Relationship.new(C_Damage.new(), null), 3)

# Consume 5 health potions
entity.remove_relationship(Relationship.new(C_HasItem.new(), C_HealthPotion), 5)
```
